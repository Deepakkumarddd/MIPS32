• Implementation of pipelined 32-bit RISC MIPS processor using verilog HDL 

    ◦ Studied processor design, pipelining, and instruction set of 32-bit MIPS and implemented using Verilog HDL
    ◦ Written test benches to carry out different algebraic operations and verified the results through timing diagrams on GTKWave
